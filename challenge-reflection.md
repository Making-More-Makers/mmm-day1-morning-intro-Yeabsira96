### Our Team Dynamics | 我们的团队动态

**Who took the leadership role? | 谁担任了领导角色？**

All three of us took on leadership roles equally. We shared responsibilities throughout the challenge, making decisions together as a team rather than having one single leader. This collaborative approach ensured everyone's voice was heard.

**How did we divide the work? | 我们如何分工？**

We divided the work equally among all team members. Each person contributed to planning, building, and testing the structure. We rotated responsibilities so everyone had the opportunity to handle different aspects of the challenge - some focused on constructing the base, others on adding height, and we all contributed to problem-solving.

**Did everyone contribute equally? | 每个人的贡献是否平等？**

Yes, everyone contributed equally. All three team members were actively involved in every stage of the challenge. We made sure to include each other's ideas and gave everyone equal time to work on the structure. Nobody sat on the sidelines - we were all hands-on.

## ✅ What Worked Well | 什么做得好

### Successful Strategies | 成功的策略

**What was our initial strategy? | 我们最初的策略是什么？**

Our initial strategy was to build a wide, stable base using the spaghetti to create a triangular foundation. We knew that a strong base was crucial for stability, so we spent time carefully constructing a firm platform before attempting to build height. We also planned to use the marshmallows strategically at connection points to absorb some of the weight.

**What worked better than expected? | 什么比预期的效果更好？**

The triangular design worked much better than expected! We were surprised at how stable the structure was when we incorporated multiple triangular supports. The marshmallows at the base provided better stabilization than we thought they would, and our decision to create cross-bracing with the spaghetti made the whole structure significantly more rigid.

**What would you do the same way if you did it again? | 如果再做一次，你会用同样的方法做什么？**

We would definitely use the same triangular base approach and the cross-bracing strategy. The focus on building a strong foundation before adding height was clearly effective. We would also maintain the collaborative, equal-contribution approach to teamwork because it kept everyone engaged and motivated.

## ❌ What Failed | 什么失败了

### Challenges We Faced | 我们面临的挑战

**What didn't work as planned? | 什么没有按计划进行？**

We initially tried to add more height too quickly without properly reinforcing the mid-section. Some of our early attempts to go higher resulted in slight wobbling. We also underestimated how brittle the spaghetti could become when stressed, so a couple of pieces broke during our testing phases.

**Why do you think it failed? | 你认为为什么失败了？**

The failures happened because we were being too ambitious with height without ensuring the structure had adequate lateral support. The spaghetti's brittleness was a material limitation we hadn't fully accounted for initially. We also learned that simply stacking height doesn't create stability - proper structural engineering with triangulation is essential.

**What was the biggest challenge? | 最大的挑战是什么？**

The biggest challenge was balancing height with stability. We wanted to build tall to rank higher, but every time we added height, the structure became more prone to tipping or breaking. Finding that sweet spot where we could maintain structural integrity while achieving significant height required careful iteration and testing.

## 🔄 Iterations | 迭代

### How We Adapted | 我们如何适应

**How many different designs did we try? | 我们尝试了多少种不同的设计？**

☐ 1  ☑ 2-3  ☐ 4-5  ☐ 6+

**Describe one major change we made during the challenge | 描述我们在挑战中做出的一个重大改变**

Our most significant change was switching from a simple single-pole design to a multi-leg structure with triangular supports. When our initial vertical pole approach showed instability, we completely redesigned using a broader base with three main legs and diagonal cross-bracing. This structural change transformed our results from wobbly to solid and stable.

**Did testing early help us? | 早期测试对我们有帮助吗？**

Yes, absolutely! Testing early allowed us to identify weaknesses before we invested too much time and materials. When we tested our first design, we quickly saw that it lacked stability. This early feedback pushed us to iterate and make the triangular redesign that ultimately proved successful. Without early testing, we might have wasted time on a design that didn't work.

## 🤝 Teamwork Lessons | 团队合作的经验

### What We Learned About Collaboration | 我们从协作中学到了什么

**What worked well in our team communication? | 我们团队沟通中什么做得好？**

Our team communication was excellent because we all listened to each other without judgment. When one person noticed a problem or suggested a change, the others immediately considered the idea seriously. We asked clarifying questions and discussed trade-offs openly. Nobody dismissed an idea without discussion, which created a safe space for all of us to contribute.

**What could we have done better as a team? | 作为一个团队，我们可以做得更好的是什么？**

We could have been more organized with our planning time. We spent a lot of time discussing but could have sketched out our designs more quickly to build faster. Also, we could have been more systematic about documenting which changes worked and why, rather than relying on memory of what we tried.

**How did we handle disagreements? | 我们如何处理分歧？**

When we disagreed about the structure, we tested both approaches to see which worked better. Rather than arguing about whose idea was right, we used the 18-minute time constraint as motivation to test quickly. This empirical approach meant the best idea won based on evidence, not persuasiveness, which was very fair.

**Did we listen to everyone's ideas? | 我们有听取每个人的想法吗？**

Yes, we definitely listened to everyone. Since we all had shared leadership, there was no hierarchy discouraging anyone from speaking up. Everyone's suggestions were given equal consideration, and we incorporated ideas from all three team members into the final design.

## ⏱️ Time Management | 时间管理

### How We Used Our 18 Minutes | 我们如何使用 18 分钟

**How much time did we spend planning vs. building? | 我们花了多少时间规划 vs. 建造？**

Planning | 规划: 4 minutes  
Building | 建造: 12 minutes

(We also spent about 2 minutes testing and making final adjustments)

**Did we have time left over or run out of time? | 我们有剩余时间还是时间不够？**

We finished with about 2 minutes to spare, which we used to make final stability checks and minor adjustments. Our time management was quite efficient - we didn't rush at the end, but we also didn't waste time on unnecessary redesigns.

**Was our time management effective? | 我们的时间管理有效吗？**

Yes, our time management was very effective. By starting to build relatively quickly after planning, we had time to test and iterate. We didn't overthink the planning phase, which allowed us to have enough building time. The spare 2 minutes at the end gave us confidence before the final measurement.

## 🔧 Engineering Thinking | 工程思维

### Design Process | 设计过程

**Did we test our structure before the final measurement? | 我们在最终测量前测试我们的结构了吗？**

☑ Yes, multiple times  
☐ Yes, once or twice  
☐ No, we ran out of time  
☐ No, we didn't think to test it

**What would we change if we had 5 more minutes? | 如果我们还有 5 分钟，我们会改变什么？**

With 5 more minutes, we would add additional diagonal bracing in the upper sections and possibly try to add another 5-10 cm of height. We might also use marshmallows more strategically for weight distribution rather than just connection points. We felt confident in our stability, so more time would have been invested in pushing the height limit further while maintaining the structural integrity.

**What engineering principles did we discover? | 我们发现了什么工程原理？**

We discovered that triangulation is key to structural stability - the triangular shapes distributed stress much better than vertical poles alone. We also learned about the importance of a wide base to create a low center of gravity, which helps prevent tipping. The concept of cross-bracing became clear to us - diagonal supports prevent shear forces much better than just vertical and horizontal members. Finally, we understood that material properties matter: spaghetti has limits to compression and bending stress, so understanding where to place the load is critical.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned | 学到的经验

### Key Takeaways | 关键收获

**The most important thing I learned from this challenge | 我从这个挑战中学到的最重要的事情**

The most important lesson was that collaboration and equal teamwork leads to better results than individual excellence. All three of us contributed ideas that made the final design better than any one of us could have created alone. Also, I learned that good engineering isn't about perfection on the first try - it's about iterating, testing, and adapting based on evidence.

**One thing I would definitely do differently next time | 下次我肯定会做得不同的一件事**

I would sketch out multiple design concepts first and evaluate them quickly before building. I think spending just a bit more time on the planning and design phase with visual sketches would help us identify the best approach faster and potentially get even better results.

**How does this challenge relate to real maker projects? | 这个挑战如何与真实的创客项目相关？**

This challenge perfectly mirrors real maker projects. Just like in real engineering, we had to work within constraints (limited materials, time limit, specific resources). We had to prototype and iterate, learning from failures rather than expecting perfection. Teamwork was essential - no maker project is done in isolation. We also experienced how resource limits force creative problem-solving. These are the exact skills used in real product design, architecture, and engineering.

## 🌟 Maker Mindset Connection | Maker 思维的联系

### How the Challenge Embodies Maker Principles | 挑战如何体现 Maker 原则

**Curiosity | 好奇**: How did we explore different possibilities?  
我们如何探索不同的可能性？

We were curious about what would happen if we tried different structural approaches. We asked questions like "What if we use three legs instead of one?" and "How does this angle affect stability?" This curiosity drove us to test multiple designs rather than settling on our first idea.

**Hands-on | 动手**: How did building teach us more than just thinking?  
建造如何比仅仅思考教会我们更多？

Actually constructing the structures taught us things we never would have discovered by talking alone. We learned about spaghetti's breaking points by experiencing them firsthand. We felt the wobble of an unstable structure and immediately understood what needed to change. Hands-on building was far more educational than planning alone.

**Fail Fast | 快速试错**: How many times did we fail and try again?  
我们失败了多少次并再次尝试？

We failed and iterated multiple times during the 18 minutes. Our first design failed the stability test, so we quickly redesigned. Some of our early attempts had pieces of spaghetti break or the structure wobble. Each failure happened quickly, and we immediately adjusted our approach rather than getting discouraged. This rapid iteration was essential to our final success.

**Iteration | 迭代**: How did we improve our design step by step?  
我们如何一步步改进我们的设计？

We improved through repeated cycles. First cycle: tall single pole - failed. Second cycle: added support legs - better but still wobbly. Third cycle: added diagonal bracing - much more stable. Fourth cycle: fine-tuned the angles and connections - achieved our final stable 45cm structure. Each iteration built on lessons from the previous attempt.

**Interdisciplinary | 跨学科**: What different skills did our team bring?  
我们的团队带来了哪些不同的技能？

Nemuleen brought strong structural thinking and visualized designs well. Avidaa was excellent at careful, precise construction and assembly. I contributed problem-solving and the ability to quickly analyze why something failed and what to try next. Together, we had design, construction, and analytical skills that created a well-rounded team.

**Open Sharing | 开源分享**: Did we look at other teams' approaches?  
我们有观察其他团队的方法吗？

Yes, we watched some other teams work and observed their approaches. Seeing another team's wide base design reinforced our choice to build a stable foundation first. We also noticed which teams ran out of time and used that as motivation to manage our own time better. Learning from others' successes and challenges was helpful.

## 🚀 Moving Forward | 展望未来

### Applying This to My Project | 将这应用到我的项目

**How will today's experience help with my maker project? | 今天的经历将如何帮助我的创客项目？**

Today's experience teaches me to start with a solid foundation and iterate based on testing rather than guessing. I now understand the importance of structural principles and the value of teamwork in solving complex problems. I'll apply the same collaborative approach, testing methodology, and willingness to fail and iterate to my maker project. I've also learned to manage my time effectively by focusing on planning first, then building.

**What team skills do I want to develop more? | 我想更多发展哪些团队技能？**

I want to develop better sketching and visualization skills so I can communicate design ideas more clearly to my team. I also want to improve my ability to give constructive feedback without hurting others' feelings. Finally, I'd like to get better at time estimation and planning so we can be even more efficient in future challenges.

**What would I do differently in my final project based on this experience? | 根据这次经历，我在最终项目中会做什么不同的事？**

I would apply the same structured approach: solid planning, quick prototyping, iterative testing, and collaborative teamwork. I would also build in more time for testing and refinement. I've learned that equal contribution from all team members actually speeds up work and improves quality, so I'll make sure to create that inclusive environment in my final project.

## 💬 Personal Reflection | 个人反思

### How I Felt | 我的感受

**What was the most frustrating moment? | 最令人沮丧的时刻是什么？**

The most frustrating moment was when we saw our second design start to wobble during testing. We'd invested time building it, but it clearly wasn't stable enough. However, looking back, that frustration actually motivated us to find the cross-bracing solution that made everything better.

**What was the most exciting moment? | 最激动人心的时刻是什么？**

The most exciting moment was when we placed the final marshmallow on top and the structure held firm at 45cm! When the instructor confirmed it stood for 5 seconds and we found out we were 3rd in the class, we felt a rush of accomplishment. All the iterations had paid off!

**Did I surprise myself in any way? | 我有没有在某方面让自己惊讶？**

Yes, I surprised myself with how well I could let go of my ideas when testing showed they didn't work. I thought I might get attached to my design concepts, but I found it easy to pivot to better approaches. I also surprised myself with how much fun collaborative problem-solving could be compared to working alone.

**On a scale of 1-10, how much fun did I have? | 按 1-10 的标度，我玩得有多开心？**

☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5 ☐ 6 ☐ 7 ☑ 8 ☐ 9 ☐ 10

I'd rate it an 8/10. It was extremely fun, competitive, and engaging. The only reason it's not a 10 is that 18 minutes goes by so fast - I would have loved more time to build even taller structures!

## ✨ Bonus: Advice for Future Teams | 额外：给未来团队的建议

**What advice would you give to someone doing this challenge for the first time?**  
**你会给第一次做这个挑战的人什么建议？**

My advice is: (1) Start by building a wide, stable base - don't go for height immediately; (2) Test early and often - failure teaches you more than planning alone ever will; (3) Make sure everyone on your team contributes equally - diverse perspectives lead to better solutions; (4) Use triangulation in your design - it's the fundamental principle that makes structures stable; (5) Don't be afraid to abandon ideas that don't work - the best design often comes after your first three attempts; (6) Manage your time by planning briefly, then building and testing quickly; and (7) Have fun with it! The challenge is as much about collaboration and problem-solving as it is about the final height. Good luck!
