## 🎯 Why I'm Here | 为什么来这里

### Why did I join the Making More Makers course? | 为什么参加 Making More Makers 课程？

I joined the Making More Makers course because I want to enhance my Arduino skills and deepen my understanding of hardware prototyping. I see this as a critical opportunity to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. I'm excited to work on real projects that combine electronics, sensing, and AI/ML - areas that fascinate me and are increasingly important in technology.

### What do I hope to gain from this experience? | 我希望从这次经历中获得什么？

I hope to gain valuable, hands-on experience with Arduino and sensor integration that I can directly apply to my own projects. Beyond technical skills, I'm looking to build portfolio-worthy projects that demonstrate my capabilities to future employers and collaborators. I also want to learn the maker mindset of iteration, testing, and rapid prototyping. Finally, I hope to develop stronger teamwork and communication skills through collaborating with other makers on real challenges.

## 💡 My Project Idea | 我的项目想法

### Project Name (if you have one) | 项目名称（如果你有的话）

**Pulse Link**

### What do I want to make? | 我想做什么？

Pulse Link is an interactive hardware prototype that reads human emotional cues using multimodal sensing. The system will combine multiple sensors (heart rate sensors, temperature sensors, maybe even EDA - electrodermal activity sensors) to capture physiological signals that correlate with different emotional states. Using machine learning algorithms, the device will interpret these signals and provide real-time feedback about the user's emotional state. The prototype could be worn as a wearable device or used in an interactive installation setting. The goal is to create a system that not only measures emotions but also provides actionable insights to help users understand their emotional responses better.

### Why do I want to make this? | 为什么想做这个？

I want to make Pulse Link because it addresses a real problem in today's fast-paced world: many people struggle to understand and manage their emotions effectively. By creating a tool that makes emotions visible and quantifiable through data, we can help people become more emotionally self-aware. This project excites me because it sits at the intersection of hardware, AI/ML, and human-centered design - three areas I'm passionate about. Additionally, an emotional sensing system could have applications in mental health support, stress management, and personal wellbeing. Having this resume-worthy project will demonstrate my ability to integrate multiple technologies into a cohesive solution.

### One specific thing I want to master | 我想掌握的一件具体事情

I want to master the integration of Arduino with machine learning models. Specifically, I want to become proficient at taking sensor data from hardware, preprocessing it, training machine learning models (Python with TensorFlow/scikit-learn), and then deploying those models back onto Arduino or similar microcontrollers. This is a critical skill gap I have, and mastering it will enable me to build intelligent hardware products like Pulse Link.

## 🌟 My Maker Identity | 我的 Maker 身份

### Which Maker principle resonates with me most? | 哪个 Maker 原则最能引起我的共鸣？

*Choose one from: Curiosity, Hands-on, Fail Fast, Iteration, Interdisciplinary, Open Sharing*  
*从以下选择一个：好奇、动手、快速试错、迭代、跨学科、开源分享*

**I choose | 我选择**: Interdisciplinary

**Because | 因为**: As an engineer who is passionate about creating products that solve real human problems, I believe that the best solutions come from combining insights across multiple disciplines. My project Pulse Link bridges hardware engineering, data science, psychology, and user experience design. I've learned that you can't build great products by staying in one field - you need to understand biology to design sensors, psychology to understand emotions, data science to process signals, and design thinking to create user-friendly interfaces. This interdisciplinary approach is what gets me excited about making, and it's what I want to develop further throughout this course.

## 🎯 My 6-Day Goals | 我的 6 天目标

### What does success look like for me at the end of this course? | 课程结束时，成功对我来说是什么样的？

Success for me means completing a working prototype of Pulse Link with at least one sensor (heart rate) successfully integrated with Arduino, demonstrating basic emotion detection capability. I also want to have a clear roadmap for incorporating AI/ML into the system, complete documentation of my project, and having gained enough confidence and experience to continue developing Pulse Link beyond this course. Additionally, I hope to have strengthened my teamwork and collaboration skills, and to have content I can confidently add to my portfolio and resume.

### Specific goals for each day | 每天的具体目标

- **Day 1**: Understand the maker mindset, complete the spaghetti challenge to learn about iteration and teamwork, reflect on lessons learned
- **Day 2**: Deep dive into Arduino programming basics and sensor integration; get hands-on experience with different sensors relevant to Pulse Link
- **Day 3**: Design and build a prototype for one sensor input (heart rate), establish basic circuit and code to read sensor data
- **Day 4**: Begin exploring machine learning options for emotion detection, research algorithms and libraries; plan the AI/ML architecture for Pulse Link
- **Day 5**: Integrate multiple sensors together, test data collection from multiple sources, refine the prototype based on testing
- **Day 6**: Polish the prototype, complete documentation, prepare a project presentation, plan next steps for bringing Pulse Link to completion

## 💬 Additional Thoughts | 其他想法

### Is there anything else you'd like to share? | 还有什么想分享的吗？

I'm excited about the opportunity to work on Pulse Link in a structured environment with mentors and peers who share my passion for making. I believe this course will be instrumental in helping me validate my project idea and develop the technical skills I need. I'm also looking forward to learning from other makers and being inspired by their projects. Beyond this course, I plan to continue developing Pulse Link and hopefully submit it to hackathons and maker fairs to get feedback from the broader community.

### Any concerns or questions? | 有任何顾虑或问题吗？

My main concern is ensuring that I can successfully integrate machine learning into the Arduino environment, as this is where my knowledge gap is largest. I'm also wondering about the best approach to design a wearable form factor that is both comfortable and reliable for continuous emotion sensing. I'd appreciate guidance on hardware-software integration best practices and recommendations for specific sensors that are proven to correlate well with emotional states. Finally, I'm curious about data privacy considerations when dealing with biometric data.
